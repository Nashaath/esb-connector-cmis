# CMIS Connector

The CMIS [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [CMIS REST API](http://docs.alfresco.com/community/pra/1/concepts/cmis-1.1-intro.html) through the ESB Profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) is the OASIS specification for content management interoperability. It allows client and servers to talk together in HTTP (REST with JSON, AtomPub or SOAP) using an unified domain model.

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring CMIS Operations](configuringCmisOperations.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.

## Additional information
For general information on using connectors and their operations in your ESB configurations, see [Using a Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Using+a+Connector).
